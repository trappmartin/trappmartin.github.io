    "Dr. Martin Trapp is an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology working on probabilistic machine learning. In addition, Martin is a member of the ELLIS society and has been a core developer of the probabilistic programming language Turing.jl.",
    "Martin's research is centred around representing, quantifying, and reducing uncertainties in machine learning for more reliable and safe application of AI. Most of his research is at the interface of tractable models, Bayesian statistics, and deep learning to develop principled and scalable techniques that have practical real-world impact.",
    "Previously, Martin was an Academy of Finland-funded independent postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University (2020-2025) and a visiting researcher at the University of British Columbia (2023) and the University of Cambridge (2018). Martin completed his PhD in Computer Science at Graz University of Technology (2015-2020) and additionally worked at the Austrian Research Institute for AI (2015-2019) and the VRVis research centre (2009-2015). His research interests are in scalable and principled methods in probabilistic machine learning with a focus on tractable models and Bayesian statistics."
