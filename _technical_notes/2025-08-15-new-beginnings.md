# Into New Beginnings... (or at least a new website)

After some time, I have finally found free time to rewrite my homepage. Over the last days, I probably tried too many different frameworks and resorted to Jekyll for simplicity at the end of the day. Some of the reasons to do so were that my Hugo website, which I liked quite a bit, became too difficult to maintain, given the little time I have available for it. So I needed something _new_, something much simpler and easier to maintain.

Eventually, I created this _new_ website with the help of Claude Sonnet, and I am rather impressed with its ability to guide me and develop a somewhat full-fledged website.

Naturally, there is still some more work to be done, such as porting some of my technical notes, but this will have to wait for now.
