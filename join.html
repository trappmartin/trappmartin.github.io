                        PhD positions are officially announced on the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/om/work-at-kth" target="_blank">KTH jobs portal</a>. Please check there regularly for open positions.
                        In addition, I occasionally have potential openings that are not yet publicly listed. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out by email.

                        <b>What am I looking for?</b>
                        My group conducts fundamental research in machine learning. I am not looking for students primarily interested in applications of ML.
                        Successful candidates should have a strong mathematical background, strong coding skills, and a genuine interest in reliability concerns of machine learning (e.g., uncertainty quantification, robustness, calibration).

                    <p>
                        I regularly participate in postdoc calls, such as the <a href="https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/" target="_blank">Digital Futures</a> postdoc fellowship program.
                        If you are interested in working together, please contact me by email.

                        <b>Requirements.</b>
                        Prospective postdocs are expected to have a strong track record of publishing at relevant top-tier venues, including but not limited to NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, UAI, AISTATS, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, and equivalent venues in ML, computer vision, or NLP.
                        Unfortunately, I cannot consider applications from candidates who have not previously published at top-tier ML/CV/NLP venues.
